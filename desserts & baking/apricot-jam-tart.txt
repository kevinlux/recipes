\ Ingredients

- Flour, 280g
- Sugar, 90g
- Oat/soy milk, 75g
- Neutral oil, 80g
- Baking powder, 1 tsp
- Vanilla
- Salt, two-finger pinch

\ Method

Whisk together all ingredients except flour until well combined.
Then add flour and knead until you get a smooth dough.
Roll out the dough to a thickness of 1/2 cm.
Drape the dough over a 20cm diameter fluted tart pan, press down, then roll the rolling pin over the top to cut.
Add apricot conserve and spread evenly.
Roll out rest of dough to 1/2 thickness, then cut 6 strips ~1.5cm wide and long enough to cover the diameter of the tart pan.
Lay the strips over the pan in a criss cross pattern.
Bake at 170c for 15 min uncovered, then for an additional 15 min covered with tin foil.
